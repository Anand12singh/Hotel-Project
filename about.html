            What Are Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)?
            Fast-moving consumer goods are products that sell quickly at relatively low cost. These goods are also called consumer packaged goods.
            
            
            FMCGs have a short shelf life because of high consumer demand (e.g., soft drinks and confections) or because they are perishable (e.g., meat, dairy products, and baked goods). These goods are purchased frequently, are consumed rapidly, are priced low, and are sold in large quantities. They also have a high turnover when they're on the shelf at the store.
            
            
             Slow-moving consumer goods, which have a longer shelf life and are purchased over time, include items like furniture and appliances.
            KEY TAKEAWAYS
            Fast-moving consumers goods are nondurable products that sell quickly at relatively low cost.
            FMCGs have low profit margins, but they account for more than half of all consumer spending.
            Examples of FMCGs include milk, gum, fruit and vegetables, toilet paper, soda, beer, and over-the-counter drugs like aspirin.</h>

        DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HALAL AND JHATKA MEAT.
        Animal slaughter for human consumption is governed globally by numerous legislations to protect the animal health aspect of the process; many of those various regulations and actions are intended to guarantee that the livestock are slaughtered in a hygienic and humane manner. However, in many nations, these same laws prohibit religious animal slaughtering activities from adhering to the ethical nature of this method, which is a major departure from the perspective of animal protection.
        
        Kosher and halal are two of the most widely used religious animal slaughter processes worldwide; legally, they are separate terms for the same practise practised by Jews and Muslims, respectively. People of two Indian sects, Hinduism and Sikhism, have historically followed the Jhatka slaughter method.
        
        Before we bust the fallacy of whether raw halal meat or Jhatka meat is better, let us first define Halal and Jhatka. In layman's words, Halal refers to the Islamic method of slaughter, while Jhatka refers to the non-Islamic method of slaughter. 'Halal' is an Arabic term that corresponds as "permissible" in English, indicating that it follows Islamic law.
        
        Jhatka and Halal slaughtering methods
        
        During halal slaughter, a sharpened knife is used at the ventral (front) portion of the animal's neck and the trachea, oesophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, and vagus nerve are truncated to cause the blood to flow out of the body before the animal dies. This ventral neck incision (VNI) procedure guarantees that the spinal nervous system remains stable before the animal dies. As this is going on, a devotion known as Tasmiya is being recited. So, Halal is ceremonial meat given to Allah, and Muslims are expected to consume only fresh halal mutton and refuse anything not offered to Allah.</div>
